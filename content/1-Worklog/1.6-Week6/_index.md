### Summary of achieved results:

#### Knowledge base

> **The Nature of AWS Budgets**
> - A powerful tool to track cash flow, measure resource productivity, and verify the efficiency of discount commitments on AWS.
> - Supports flexible limit setups by Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually periods.
> - Provides proactive email notifications as soon as the system detects actual or forecasted costs exceeding the allowable threshold.
> - Acts as a "shield" to protect the learner's wallet, preventing the risk of generating large, uncontrollable bills.
> - **Core note:** AWS Budgets only acts as a monitoring and alerting system; this service absolutely does NOT automatically shut down or interfere with the operational status of running resources.

**AWS Billing and Cost Management Console**
- Proficient in searching and accessing the financial management center from the AWS Console.
- Clearly understand that this is the central hub for all data regarding invoices, cash flow analysis, limit setups, and spending alert rules.
- Know how to use the Budgets navigation menu to manage the lifecycle of a budget (Create - Edit - Monitor - Delete).

**Creating Budgets via Template**
- Understand the benefits of using pre-built templates to streamline the process and save time.
- Know how to select the "Use a template" mode for basic needs.
- Successfully apply the "Monthly cost budget" configuration to quickly establish a monthly cost management framework with email notifications.
- Know how to view Budget history to evaluate future spending trends.

**Configuring Cost Budgets**
- Understand that a Cost Budget focuses on the monetary amount (in USD) incurred when using services.
- Know how to deeply configure using Customize mode with the Cost budget type.
- Distinguish between two types of period applications:
  - *Recurring Budget:* Automatically renews and repeats in the next cycle.
  - *Expiring Budget:* Has a fixed expiration date and is valid only once.
- Distinguish between two budgeting methods:
  - *Fixed:* Set a constant, equal amount for every month.
  - *Planned:* Flexibly adjust the limit amount up or down for specific months.
- Know how to configure the overall monitoring scope (All AWS services) and choose to aggregate by Unblended costs.

**Configuring Usage Budgets**
- Recognize that a Usage Budget monitors the volume or consumption time of resources rather than the monetary value.
- Clearly differentiate: Cost Budgets manage the pressure of "Money," while Usage Budgets manage the pressure of "Frequency/Running Time."
- Know how to configure filters by Usage type groups, typically monitoring the running hours of a Load Balancer (`EC2: ELB - Running Hours`).
- Realize that a Usage Budget is extremely useful for monitoring background resources that can easily cause waste over time, such as NAT Gateways, EC2, and ELB.

**Understanding Reservation & Savings Plans Budgets**
- Grasp the theory behind Reservation Budgets (managing RIs) and Savings Plans Budgets (managing compute savings plans).
- Understand that these two types help enterprises measure coverage and utilization metrics of upfront investments or long-term commitments to prevent waste.
- Realize these are advanced features, usually applied in real-world Production environments. Do not arbitrarily activate or purchase real plans in a personal account to avoid unexpected long-term commitment costs.

**Alert Thresholds & Health Monitoring Mechanism**
- Know how to set alert tiers based on two criteria: Actual costs or Forecasted costs.
- Successfully set up multi-tier rules (e.g., trigger an alert at 50%, send a serious reminder at 80%, and a red alert at 100%).
- Understand how Budget health works to quickly filter out which budgets are in the safe zone or the danger zone.
- Understand the data latency mechanism of AWS Billing so as not to panic when figures are not synchronized instantly.

**The Importance of Cleanup**
- Realize that Cleaning Up after every lab session is a mandatory skill to maintain a clean infrastructure and avoid notification spam.
- Firmly grasp the principle: Deleting AWS Budgets configurations only removes the checking and email rules; it completely does not affect or interrupt the services delivering applications in the account.

### Challenges and obstacles faced:

- The Billing and Cost Management dashboard integrates many analytical tools (Bills, Cost Explorer, Budgets, etc.), making the initial approach confusing among the features.
- The theoretical boundary between a Cost Budget and a Usage Budget can easily be mixed up if one does not stick closely to the unit of measurement (USD vs. Output/Running hours).
- The `Usage type groups` directory has a very broad filter, requiring careful reading and exact searching for the keyword `EC2: ELB - Running Hours` to avoid mistakenly selecting other services.
- Due to the asynchronous update mechanism (Data Latency) of AWS, monetary metrics and historical charts do not show changes immediately after creation, making it difficult to verify instant results.
- Advanced knowledge related to RIs and Savings Plans is relatively abstract because students have not yet had the chance to encounter large-scale cost optimization problems in reality.
- If email syntax is not checked carefully or verification is forgotten, the alert system may fail to deliver messages to the inbox as expected.

### Solutions and lessons learned:

- Always maintain the habit of carefully reading every technical instruction in the guide document before clicking on the AWS Console interface.
- Systematize the nature of the tools with a concise mind map:
  - *Cost Budget:* Manages the wallet.
  - *Usage Budget:* Manages the running hours/capacity of resources.
  - *Reservation / Savings Plans Budget:* Monitors the efficiency of upfront commitment plans.
- Set smart notification thresholds (from low to high) to create buffer zones, giving yourself time to intervene and handle resources before hitting the 100% mark.
- Strictly adhere to account safety principles: Do not click to buy or activate any real RI/Savings Plans commitments while doing a learning lab.
- Thoroughly clean up experimental configurations immediately after finishing the lab to keep the learning environment standardized.
- Combine using AWS Budgets with manually reviewing the Billing Dashboard periodically after each study session to early detect hidden costs.

### Plan and roadmap for next week:

- Continue to delve deeper into the supplementary modules within the AWS Billing and Cost Management ecosystem.
- Shift focus to researching **AWS Cost Explorer** to learn how to break down and analyze costs deeply by tags, services, and time dimensions.
- Learn how to track free tier limits through the **AWS Free Tier Dashboard**.
- Approach anomalous cost detection solutions using machine learning with **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**.
- Understand the centralized financial management model for a chain of multiple accounts through the **AWS Organizations** service.
- Maintain and practice the habit of checking the Billing Dashboard periodically to enhance FinOps (cloud cost optimization) mindset.

### 💡 A small tip for you to avoid duplication (plagiarism):
1. **Proof images (`📸 Proof...`):** This is the part that proves your own work. Rename the screenshots using your own consistent structure, for example: `week6_budgets_01.png`, `week6_cost_budget_actual.png`, etc.
2. **Amount limit:** In the sections mentioning "enter the monthly spending limit," when doing the actual lab, enter an odd or specific number of your choice (e.g., `10 USD`, `15 USD`) and put that specific number into the report instead of writing generally to create a unique touch for your report.
